# SHCF
The code and dataset of SDM 2021 paper "Sequence-aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Collaborative Filtering"

This is a fork of [the original version](https://github.com/LeeChenChen/SHCF), with some bug fixed.

## Requirements

Python == 3.6
Tensorflow == 1.12

If you are using RTX GPU, consider the NVidia's tensorflow(+python3.8): https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorflow#install

And any version of scikit-learn (version 1.3.0 works)

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/c0mm4nd/SHCF && cd SHCF
python src/SHCF.py 
```
